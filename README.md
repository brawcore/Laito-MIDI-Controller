# Laito-MIDI-Controller
Versatile Foot and Gesture Controlled MIDI Device for Live Performances
The Laito MIDI Controller is a personal project designed to meet the specific demands of live performances, particularly for musicians seeking a foot-controlled or one-handed gesture-based device. This controller incorporates infrared (IR) sensors, potentiometers, and buttons to send MIDI notes and/or CC messages.

As a bassist myself, I created the Laito MIDI Controller to address my own requirements on stage. Recognizing the need for a hands-free or single-handed control option, I developed a device that offers musicians like me the flexibility to navigate their MIDI setup seamlessly during live performances.

The Laito MIDI Controller combines various input mechanisms to provide a comprehensive MIDI control solution. The inclusion of IR sensors allows for gesture-based interactions, enabling intuitive and expressive control. Additionally, the potentiometers and buttons offer tactile and precise control over MIDI notes and CC messages.

With its ergonomic design, the Laito MIDI Controller ensures comfort and ease of use, allowing musicians to focus on their performance without distraction. Its compact size and portability make it a convenient companion for gigs and rehearsals, while its customizable features ensure compatibility with diverse MIDI setups.

Whether you're a bassist, guitarist, or any other musician in need of a versatile MIDI controller, the Laito MIDI Controller is here to enhance your live performances. Empowering you with foot-controlled and one-handed gesture-based capabilities, this controller will help you unleash your creativity and take your musical expression to new heights.
